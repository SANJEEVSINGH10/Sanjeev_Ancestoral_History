This website serves me pupose as to tell my acestor's history

So ten days back i was scrolling through social feed & in that one gentleman posted & through that he was asking that was any important part been played by any Kshatriya or Rajput Legend ?

That hit me & to know the answer to that I went to my father instantly & asked my kul name & after I get to know that.
I took the research work into my hand & after 10ndays of hard research throuh the internet & books ,
I found out many answers such as that I belong to "SAKARWAL RAJPUT" Clan which belongs to "SOORYAVANSHI KSHATRIYA CLAN"

One can visit the website & can get the information from
https://sanjeevsingh10.github.io/Sanjeev_Ancestoral_History/
SO I found out that I belong to the great GOD/Legend of Indian History i.e., "LORD SHREE RAM JI" & 
this why I made this website to tell that yes my Ancestors did many good for the history & I am very proud of It.
